This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/) for [rabbitmq](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/) (not to be confused with any official rabbitmq image provided by rabbitmq upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full description from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/) is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [docker-library/docs/rabbitmq](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/rabbitmq).
